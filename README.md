# Concordance

This progam builds a concordance given an arbitrary text document written in English. A concordance is an alphabetical list of all word occurrences in the text document. The concordance provides the overall count for a word, followed by a colon, and then the sentence numbers in which each occurrence appeared.  
  
To run the program simply run "python3 concordance.py <input_file>" in the terminal and then the resulting concordance will be in file named concordance_output.txt  
  
The files I used for <input_file> are all stored in the files/ folder
