The story "clifford the big red dog" follows a big ol doggy that gets to big (I mean way to big). This dog's owner happens to be
a little girl I think, I have no idea how she takes care of this dog the size of her house. Matter of fact how does he even get this big
like I am so confused. Also I have never seen a red dog, how is he red that is not a natural dog color. Maybe I'm forgetting something 
from the story that explains why he is red like a firetruck. Also they made a movie on this story and for some reason the cops show up
to take down the dog like what! It's just a dog I personally don't think the police needs to be involved in this, unless this is some 
sort of godzilla situation which I very much doubt.
